Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engeneering princple, methods, and the development of high-quality software systems.
Software engineering enable the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages.
Structured programming in the 1970s.
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - creating high-level and detailed design of software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
Testing - conducting various tests to ensure that the software meets quality standard and functional requirements.
Deployment - releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance - providing ongoing support, update, and enhancement to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall, quality is managed through detailed planning and extensive testing. In agile continuous intergration and testing are employed to ensure quality throughout
the development process.
Both methodologies aim to deliver a final product without defects and meets quality standards.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - responsible for writing code and implementing solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - oversees the planning, executions and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integraded Development Environments(IDEs) - provide comprehensive tools for writting, debugging, and testing a code.
Version Control Systems(VCS) - track changes of the source code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Advancement of Technology - engineers must stay up-to date with the latest technologies.
Software Testing Conflicts - find a way to manage the conflicts.
Changing Requiremets - engineers must adapt to the changes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - test individual components.
System testing - test the entire software system.
Acceptance testing - test the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by generative AI model

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Please write me a product description of a new sneaker" , it could bring back almost anything.
This is how it is suppose to be "Please write me a product description of a new nike sneaker". It is effective because now the AI will understand the name of a sneaker I want.
